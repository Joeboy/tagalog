# Tagalog

Time tracker using Tauri / React. Basically a crappy react app with a Tauri wrapper. No Rust other than the Tauri boilerplate.

Add log entries, with a search for previous log entries so you can copy them.

Entries are stored in an sqlite db, for me it's at `$HOME/.config/com.tagalog.app/tagalog_entries.db`.
